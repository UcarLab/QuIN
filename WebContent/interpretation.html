		</div>
		<div>A network is composed of many connected components which
			are a subset of nodes that are all connected via edges. A connected
			component is such that there exists a path from one node to every
			other node within the component for any node in the component.</div>
		<br /> <br /> <br />
		<div>
			<img src="images/interpret2.png" width="840" height="355" />
		</div>
		<div>The network statistics box displays information about all
			of the components, nodes, and edges in the network, while the
			component statistics box displays just the node and edge information
			for the currently viewed connected component. Super-imposing datasets
			onto the network will color the nodes differently depending on
			whether or not the super-imposed datasets overlap with the regions of
			the nodes. If more than one annotation exists, nodes will display all
			of the colors in a "pie-chart" visualization.</div>

			<b>Viewing Node Information:</b>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src="images/interpret3.png" width="750" height="567" />
		</div>
		<div>Right clicking or double tapping a node will display more
			information about that node including the number of PETs and
			Interactions overlapping to define the node, the region the node
			occupies, any associated diseases or SNPs and network measures
			calculated on the node. There are also various links provided as a
			convenience to further analyze the node of interest.</div>

		<div>Above provides a brief description of the different network
			measures provided when viewing more information about a node.</div>
		<br /> <br /> <br />
		<div>
			<b>Network Measure Boxplots:</b>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src="images/interpret5.png" />
		</div>
		<div>For each network measure calculated a boxplot can be viewed
			in the network measures tab. The boxplot provides a way of briefly
			analyzing whether certain annotations exhibit certain typs of
			topologies in the network. In the above example, promoters of genes
			are showing to have a slight higher degree.</div>
